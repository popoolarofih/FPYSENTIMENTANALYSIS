FPY Sentiment Analysis using LSTM
This project analyzes the emotional experiences of scholars during the Farm Practice Year (FPY) program using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) powered by LSTM neural networks. The goal is to uncover how different aspects of the FPY affect participants' emotional well-being and potentially influence academic performance and retention.

🧠 Project Overview
The FPY is an intensive, hands-on agricultural training program. While its academic and practical components are well documented, students’ emotional responses have been largely unexamined. This project processes and analyzes textual data (journals, surveys, and feedback) to assess sentiment around key aspects of the program.
